# JavaScript Password Generator 

This my take on a javaScript password generator that I created using only HTML, CSS and javaScript. I added a screen shot of the running App also added a video that shows the functionality of the password generator.

## Technologies

* HTML to write the structure of the website.
* CSS to style the website.
* JavaScript to  add the functionality to the password generator.

##  Editors 

* [Microsoft Visual Studio code:]( https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ ) this an awesome all around editor that is highly recommended by most software and web developers.
* [Notepad ++:]( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ )  this a very light weight code editor that packs a big punch.
